{% include result_header.html testRun=page.testRun suite="Composite" %}

Tests using curves that don't have a prime order/nearly prime order.
These tests should generally fail, a success here implies the card <b>WILL</b> use a non-secure curve if such curve is set
by the applet. Operations over such curves are susceptible to small-subgroup attacks.
